# UI-UX-Design-Portfolio

## Design Process – 5 Key Steps
This UI was designed following human-centered design principles, inspired by my learning from the **Google UX Design Professional Certificate** and my **To-Let Globe internship**:

1️⃣ Empathize – Understanding user needs for an intuitive property search experience

2️⃣ Define – Identifying key pain points in property browsing and selection

3️⃣ Ideate – Brainstorming creative UI solutions for seamless navigation

4️⃣ Prototype – Designing interactive wireframes and high-fidelity UIs in Figma

5️⃣ Test – Refining based on usability feedback for better user engagement

## Figma Animation Carousel
☕ Coffee Shop 3D Carousel – Figma Prototype 🎡

Designed an interactive 3D carousel for a coffee shop theme in Figma! ✨ This prototype showcases smooth transitions, Smart Animate effects, and a modern UI to enhance the browsing experience. The carousel elegantly highlights different coffee blends, special offers, and cozy vibes.

👆 Tap on the coffee to explore! Watch the carousel smoothly transition between different coffee blends, special offers, and cozy vibes.
